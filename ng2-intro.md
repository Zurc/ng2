# Angular 2 - Intro

This is another source for anyone who wants to learn Angular 2. A few tips on how was my way to test different features from a real-world project.

## Requirements - Set up

Two different ways: 

* Online - ( e.g. using Plunker )
* Local - ( node.js )
  * Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and update the npm package manager.
  * This is a [quick tutorial](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node) on how to do that.

#### Online

Very fast. Fork this plunker site and you are ready to go [Here](https://plnkr.co/edit/kjOZa4i3IoI84kurK3Xc?p=preview)
